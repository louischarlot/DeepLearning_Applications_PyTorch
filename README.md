# Deep Learning applications on PyTorch

This repository contains some Deep Learning personal applications, using different methods (CNN, GAN, RNN), to solve diverse problems...

## Table Of Contents

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

* [Face recognition](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks): Application of CNN to a face recognition problem. We use here the **XXXnet** pre-trained network.


### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/gan-mnist): Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.


### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how to implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.


### Transformers

* [LSTM](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks): [QUORA!](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-transformer-in-deep-learning)
