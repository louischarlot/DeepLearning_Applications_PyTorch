# Deep Learning applications on PyTorch

This repository contains some Deep Learning personal applications, using different methods (CNN, GAN, RNN), to solve diverse problems...

## Table Of Contents

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

* Image classification: 
-- In a [first notebook](https://github.com/louischarlot/DeepLearning_Applications_PyTorch/blob/main/CNN/Image_classification_transfer.ipynb), we use **transfer learning** from a pre-trained Residual Neuronal Network (**ResNet**) to classify images from the XXX dataset.
-- In a [second notebook](https://github.com/louischarlot/DeepLearning_Applications_PyTorch/blob/main/CNN/Image_classification_implemented.ipynb), we **implement** and train a **ResNet** from scratch, given that the pre-trained ResNet is not adapted to the small images of the CIFAR10 datset we want to classify.

We implement and train a  to classify the images from the CIFAR10 dataset.

* [Face recognition](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks): Application of CNN to a face recognition problem. We use here the **XXXnet** pre-trained network.


### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/gan-mnist): Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.


### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how to implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.


### Transformers

* [LSTM](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks): [QUORA!](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-transformer-in-deep-learning)
