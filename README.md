# Deep Learning projects

This repository contains several Deep Learning personal projects using different methods to solve diverse problems...

## Table Of Contents

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks): Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.


### Generative Adversarial Networks

* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/gan-mnist): Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.


### Recurrent Neural Networks

* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how to implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.
